# *CS 25-323 Modular Feedback*
## *Sponsor: Capital One*
## *Short Project Description*
Problem statement - “As a platform stakeholder, how can I collect feature specific feedback in a way that can be extensible to the Enterprise?”
 1. Iteration 1
     - a. Create a web component UI module (or in Gravity?) that can be used in a plug-and-play fashion. Providing a “thumbs up” and “thumbs down” option to capture basic sentiment.
     - b. Integrated with Clickstream out of the box (needs to be flexible to handle different implementations)
     - c. Create basic Clickstream dashboard to display results for teams to review effectiveness of the feature
 2. Iteration 2
     - a. For the “thumbs down” scenario, allow users to input their concerns into a textbox and determine a storage solution for these inputs.
     - b. PCI data filter implementation.
     - c. Create admin feedback UI to view feature specific verbatims and possible enhancements.

 Assumptions:
 1. Students have access to clickstream storage
