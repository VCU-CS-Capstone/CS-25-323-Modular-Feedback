**Project Description:
Problem statement - “As a platform stakeholder, how can I collect feature specific feedback in a way that can be extensible to the Enterprise?”
 1. Iteration 1
 a. Create a web component UI module (or in Gravity?) that can be used in a plug-and-play fashion. Providing a “thumbs up” and “thumbs down” option to capture basic sentiment.
 b. Integrated with Clickstream out of the box (needs to be flexible to handle different implementations)
 c. Create basic Clickstream dashboard to display results for teams to review effectiveness of the feature
 2. Iteration 2
 a. For the “thumbs down” scenario, allow users to input their concerns into a textbox and determine a storage solution for these inputs.
 b. PCI data filter implementation.
 c. Create admin feedback UI to view feature specific verbatims and possible enhancements.
 
 Assumptions:
 1. Students have access to clickstream storage
